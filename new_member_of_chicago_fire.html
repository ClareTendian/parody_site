            5SOS member, Calum Hood was a soccer player before he joined his band. Doing soccer has always been his dream before music came into his life. He would never stop practicing day and night. He even went to Brazil to represent Austrailia. Now 5 years later after the band became a band, he got a huge oppertunity to play for the Chicago Fire soccer team in Chicago. He couldn't miss the oppertunity of a life time. It was really hard to say goodbye to his bandmates also best friends and brothers. Instead of saying goodbye or talking about the situation with his bandmates, he just picked up his packed bags and left for Chicago. The bandmakes were surprised to not see him in the mmorning and at song writing session. Michale Clifford, one of Calum's close friends before the band was created said,"It isn't like him to just leave like that with no explaination." Ashton Irwin, drummer of the band said,"I thought it was going so well. He was important to us in the band." Luke Hemmings was too upset and angry so he couldn't be placed into the interview/article. The three members of 5SOS feel like Calum traded them for soccer (football) and that the band meant nothing to him.
            5SOS members are in the process of figuring out what happened to their bass player and why he left.
